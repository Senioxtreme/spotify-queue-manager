## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Deployment

Setup is straightforward and takes about 10 minutes. The system is designed to be "set it and forget it."

### Prerequisites

-   A **Spotify Premium** account (required to use the queue feature).
-   A **Cloudflare** account.
-   **Python 3.x** installed on your computer (only needed for the initial setup).

### Step 1: Configure the Spotify Developer App

1.  Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and log in.
2.  Click on **"Create app"**.
3.  Give it a name (e.g., "My Event Jukebox") and a description.
4.  Once created, copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Keep them handy.
5.  Click on **"Edit settings"**.
6.  In the **"Redirect URIs"** field, add **exactly** this line: `http://localhost:8888/callback`
7.  Save the changes.

### Step 2: Get the Refresh Token

We'll use the provided Python script to authenticate once and get a long-lasting `refresh_token`.

1.  Open the `get_token.py` file.
2.  Paste your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` variables.
3.  Install the required dependency by opening a terminal and running: `pip install spotipy`
4.  Run the script: `python get_token.py`
5.  Your browser will open. Log in to Spotify and authorize the application.
6.  ‚úÖ When done, a `spotify_refresh_token.txt` file will be created. Copy the long string inside it.

### Step 3: Deploy on Cloudflare Pages

1.  Fork this repository or clone it to your own GitHub account.
2.  Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard and go to **Workers & Pages**.
3.  Create a new **Pages** application and connect it to the GitHub repository you just created.
4.  Cloudflare will automatically detect the correct build settings. Proceed with the setup.
5.  Before the final deploy, go to **Settings -> Environment variables** and add the following variables (for both "Production" and "Preview"):
    -   `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`: Your Client ID from Spotify.
    -   `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Client Secret from Spotify.
    -   `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN`: The refresh token you copied from the `.txt` file in Step 2.
    -   `EVENT_NAME`: The name of your event (e.g., `End of Year Party`).
6.  Save the variables and click **"Save and Deploy"**.

### Step 4: Done!

Your application is now live at the URL provided by Cloudflare, fully functional and autonomous!

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1.  Share the Cloudflare URL with your guests.
2.  Make sure your Spotify account is active and playing music on a device (e.g., a smart speaker).
3.  Guests can search for tracks, listen to previews, and add them to the queue.
4.  Everyone can see what's currently playing in the "Now Playing" tab.

## üß© Troubleshooting

-   **"No active devices"**: Ensure Spotify is open and playing music on at least one device linked to the Premium account.
-   **"500 Errors or App Fails to Load"**: Double-check that the environment variable names and values were entered correctly in the Cloudflare dashboard, with no extra spaces.
